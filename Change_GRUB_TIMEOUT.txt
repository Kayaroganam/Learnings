Change GRUB_TIMEOUT
To change the timeout in GRUB, open the /etc/default/grub file:

$ sudo gedit /etc/default/grub
Comment the GRUB_TIMEOUT_STYLE option and set the GRUB_TIMEOUT:

#GRUB_TIMEOUT_STYLE=hidden
GRUB_TIMEOUT=5
If you have already tried to change the GRUB_TIMEOUT but this still doesn’t work and the GRUB menu appears on every boot with the 30 second timeout, add the following line at the end of the /etc/default/grub file:

GRUB_RECORDFAIL_TIMEOUT=$GRUB_TIMEOUT
This sets the GRUB_RECORDFAIL_TIMEOUT to the same value as the GRUB_TIMEOUT.

Generate a new configuration file:

$ sudo update-grub
Reboot the system to see if the GRUB’s timeout has changed.
